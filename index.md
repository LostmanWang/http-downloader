# HTTP-Downloader

HTTP-Downloader is an modern and advanced downloading tool which helps you to hack your downloads. Unlike traditional download managers, HTTP-Downloader offers you many features like

### Resume failed downloads
HTTP-Downloader can request the remaining part of any file to server. By this you can resume failed downloads from even third party apps like chrome

### Download file as parts
If you are having limited storage space on your device, you can download the whole file as several small parts. Download a part, move it to any external storage medium and download next part. After completion you can join all parts to get the full file back

### Download using multiple devices
As HTTP-Downloader can request download from anywhere, it can split your download among your devices. So, if you have 3 Android devices and a 6GB file to download, each device downloads 2GB parts. Since devices can together download files, you can achieve 3X speed for download. After completion of downloads, you can join them from any device (or a windows/linux PC) to get full file
