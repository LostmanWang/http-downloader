# HTTP-Downloader

HTTP-Downloader is an modern and advanced downloading tool which helps you to hack your downloads. Unlike traditional download managers, HTTP-Downloader offers you many features like

### Resume failed downloads
HTTP-Downloader can request the remaining part of any file to server. By this you can resume failed downloads from even third party apps like Google Chrome, FireFox etc.. Just click on download link, select your failed file and enjoy your download getting resumed from where it stopped. _Note: We don't guarantee 100% compatibility with any third party app even though it works fine in most cases._
##### How to use
1. Launch app. Tap on **+** icon on top right. Select **Start new task**
2. Now select **Resume a failed download** & follow on screen instructions

### Download using multiple devices together
As HTTP-Downloader can request download from anywhere, it can split your download among your devices. So, if you have 3 Android devices and a 6GB file to download, each device downloads 2GB parts. Since devices can download files together, you can achieve 3X speed for download. After completion of downloads, you can join them from any device (Android, Windows, Linux or Mac) to get full file
##### How to use
1. Launch app. Tap on **+** icon on top right. Select **Start new task**
2. Now select **Download using 2 (_or more_) devices** & follow on screen instructions

### Forget about storage left on device
Even if you are low on storage, you can download a small part of your file, which fits your device's storage. Download file part, move it to a storage medium, download next part and continue. After completing, you can join all the parts to get your full file.
##### How to use
1. Launch app. Tap on **+** icon on top right. Select **Start new task**
2. Now select **Download a File part** & follow on screen instructions

### Overcome size limits
Most of external SD-Cards can't handle files of size more than 4GB. So you cannot download a file of size 5GB to an SDCard with even 50GB free. In such cases HTTP-Downloader comes handy as it can automatically split files to several parts while downloading. So you can download the 5GB file as two 2.5GB parts, and later join them from a PC.
##### How to use
1. Launch app. Tap on **+** icon on top right. Select **Start new task**
2. Now select **Download as several parts** & follow on screen instructions

### Bypass speed restrictions
Some web-servers limit speed per connection to limit their network traffic. In such cases, you can simply download file as two or more different parts. Since it makes several parallel connection, your speed hikes multiple times. For servers enforcing speed limit per IP, try [Download using multiple devices together](#download-using-multiple-devices-together)
##### How to use
1. Launch app. Tap on **+** icon on top right. Select **Start new task**
2. Now select **Download as several parts** & follow on screen instructions

### Download directly to cloud storage
Since HTTP-Downloader uses modern [Storage Access Framework](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider) of Android, users can choose any writable location from document picker UI including their cloud drives. So download will be directly tunnelled to their cloud storage without using any storage space on your device's local storage.<br/>
_Since this feature is an addon and we don't natively support it, it is available only from advanced mode_. Native support for Google drive is in our todo list and will be ready within a couple of months after release.
##### How to use
1. Launch app. Tap on **+** icon on top right. Select **Advanced download**.
2. Click on browser icon to go to browser and click on your download link.
3. Choose **Choose file** option. From file picker, choose a file in your cloud drive.
4. Uncheck **Create a blank file first** to avoid double network usage (firstly for making file & then for downloading).
5. Click on next icon to review & click again to start download.
