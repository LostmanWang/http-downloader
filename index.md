# HTTP-Downloader

HTTP-Downloader is an modern and advanced downloading tool which helps you to hack your downloads. Unlike classic download managers, HTTP-Downloader offers you many features like

### Resume failed downloads
HTTP-Downloader can request the remaining part of any file to server. By this you can resume failed downloads from even third party apps like chrome

### Download file as parts
If you are having limited storage space on your device, you can download the whole file as several small parts. Download a part, move it to any external storage medium and download next part. After completion you can join all parts to get the full file back
