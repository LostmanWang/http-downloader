# What's new in HTTP-Downloader
HTTP-Downloader has undergone rigorous revamp, which heavily increased its capabilities.

### Brief history
HTTP-Downloader was built for internal use by Resonance. It was similar to console (Terminal) application at that time.
Later we realized that it would do a great help if it was released outside for general users.
Therefore we added a graphical user interface for HTTP-Downloader & published it on Google play.
Ads were Incorporated to it to recover the cost we have encountered while developing the application.
HTTP-Downloader's UI was still complicated for general users. So we decided to fully recreate HTTP-Downloader's UI and features to make it more user friendly.
This improved update for HTTP-Downloader focuses on user friendliness and reliability.

### Changes in this update
1. **Parallel downloads:** The new update allows you to download upto 2 parallel files in free version & upto 99 parallel files in pro version.
2. **Multi-tab support for browser:** Inbuilt browser is heavily improved & it supports unlimited number of tabs.
3. **Heavily simplified UI:** Previous HTTP-Downloader was designed targeting geeks as its users. So it used technical words & complex UI which most of naive users won't understand. 
This update targets such naive users so that most people can use it easily.
4. **Support for automatic file splitting in SD-Cards:** Since most SDCards are formatted to FAT32 (or vFAT), it couldn't be used to download files more than 4GB.
Using previous HTTP-Downloader, users manually needed to specify offset & limit to split it manually. New HTTP-Downloader automatically does it for you
5. **Create empty file before download:** This helps you to avoid storage space issues while downloading.
6. **Split files & download them together:** Helps you avoid speed limit per connection set by server
7. **And much more**
